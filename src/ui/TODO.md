# UI Todo

- [ ] Add a most recently active view for each type of view

      For example, when you click a buffer in the Steps view
      it should show the buffer in the most recent buffer view

- [ ] Settings
  - [ ] Make it so you can pop out into separate window

  - [ ] Choose whether it's an overlay or a sidebar

  - [ ] Overlay it's over the content, Side bar it takes
        up a portion of the window so the content thinks
        the window is smaller (like devtools)

  - [ ] Select overlay position (top, left, right, bottom)

  - [ ] Add option to wrap steps.
  
        Some lines will be long
        so it'd be nice not to have to scroll to see them?
        But some users might want 1 step per line

- [ ] Let user drag/size UI (right now hard coded to 50%)

- [ ] Add Save/Load

- [ ] Add Icons for buttons

- [ ] Add Icons for steps

- [ ] Show Frames, Let you select a frame, updates most recently

- [ ] Make pane bars have split icon

- [ ] Make pane bars have drop down for view type

- [ ] Make it save layout to local store

- [ ] Make keyboard dispatch to get keys from one level and
